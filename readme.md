# Foodpicker

## A webapplication to help you choose your next takeout and by tracking your taste

### ToDo's (prioritized):
- new order attribute: delivery driver found place without help (add to scoreSystem)
- Page for individual restaurants
  - Editing of restaurant details
- dashboard
  - restaurant list with sorting
  - statistics
- login (user will be created manually)
  - firewall for create and edit

### Ideas:
- use the same edit template for all
- For statistics:
  - money spent
  - times ordered
  - number of items ordered
  - number of unused restaurants
  - github like acitivity map for each restaurant (frequency of orders on day x)

### Scoring System:
+ 10 base score per order
- 3 if faulty
+ 3 if bonus
+ 5 if delivery before 12 o'clock
- 2 if delivery takes more than 1 hour
- 3 if over 1,5 hours
+ additional custom points (pos / neg)

### Done:
- carbon format issue when editing
- edit orders
- plan scoring system (what action gives how many points etc)
